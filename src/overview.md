# Overview

SuperSlicer was started by supermerill as a fork from PrusaSlicer back in 
2014 mainly to add bugfixes that didn't make their way into PrusaSlicer's
main release.
Over time SuperSlicer evolved and wasn't limited to just bugfixes any more.
Instead more advanced features were developed and made SuperSlicer the very
advanced slicing software it is today.

SuperSlicer aims to be compatible with most modern 3D printer firmwares such 
as:

* Reprap Firmware (RRF)
* Marlin
* Klipper
* Smoothieware
