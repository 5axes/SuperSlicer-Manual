## Issue Tracker

If a bug has been found in the software, or you want to raise any other
issue, you can post to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/issues).

Before submitting a new issue, please make sure you've read the guidelines below.

## Guidelines for reporting an issue

Keep in mind that developers are working on a volunteer basis, and the volume
of requests related to SuperSlicer is overwhelming. Please understand that 
the more **complete and clear** you make your request the more chances 
it has being recognized and successfully processed.

* There is a good chance that the issue, you have encountered, is already reported.
  Please check the [list of reported issues](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/issues)
  before creating a new issue. If you find an existing issue report, feel free
  to add further information to that report.
* Include a **3MF file of your buildplate** (saved from *File* -> *Save project as...*)
  this is important to **reproduce your issue**.
* Include **screenshots of the G-code preview** demonstrating that the issue can be
  seen in the G-code and it's not caused by mechanical problems or by the firmware.
* Specify SuperSlicer's version (or commit number) and operating system.
* Make sure the STL file you are using is manifold (failure to repair a broken model is not
  considered a bug; we only deal with bugs reproducible with valid models).
* Include one issue per report. If you encounter multiple, unrelated issues,
  please report them as such.

## Guidelines for requesting features

SuperSlicer is a community project, and features are usually added whenever there is
general consensus on them. Please start by describing your *goal* by showing
a concrete case. Show G-code of a real case produced with current SuperSlicer
and describe what would you like to improve and why. Put effort into documenting
this with pictures, G-code preview screenshots, close inspection.

After you're focused on **why** you can move onto ideas for **how** to achieve that
goal. But don't invert the order and the efforts.
